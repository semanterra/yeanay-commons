This project is for dependencies common to both client and server projects.


The `root` directory contains config files for eg tsconfig and tslint.
These can be extended in other projects.

The `doc/rules` directory contains standards that are kept (at least
as a goal) across all projects.

Module design should never drag a lot of unnecessary baggage into client bundles.
